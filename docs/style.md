Glassmorphism
Visual Identity: Frosted glass effect with translucent panels, backdrop blur, subtle light borders and multi-layered depth creating floating elements.

Color Strategy: Vibrant gradients or saturated backgrounds visible through semi-transparent surfaces; high-contrast text over blurred content.

Implementation Notes: Apply backdrop-filter: blur() with semi-transparent backgrounds (rgba), add 1px light borders for definition, use soft shadows for depth and ensure strong text contrast for legibility.

Neo-brutalism
Visual Identity: Raw, bold, slightly "harsh" layouts with thick borders, large typography and minimal decoration.

Color Strategy: High contrast, solid blocks of saturated color; limited gradients; frequent use of black/white for structure.

Implementation Notes: Build rigid grids, flat panels with strong outlines, oversized headings and simple hover animations (color or border only).

Soft minimalism
Visual Identity: Clean, calm interfaces with generous whitespace, soft geometry and friendly typography.

Color Strategy: Muted, warm palettes with 1–2 accent colors for focus states and key actions.

Implementation Notes: Combine rounded containers, light elevation, minimal iconography and reduced motion; prioritize readability and accessibility.

Immersive 3D
Visual Identity: Hero sections or key visuals using realistic 3D objects, depth and atmospheric lighting.

Color Strategy: Limited base palette, with 3D assets providing richer color and light accents.

Implementation Notes: Integrate 3D renders or Lottie-style animations, parallax scroll, and depth via layered foreground/background elements.
