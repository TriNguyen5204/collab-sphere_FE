| Style | Visual Identity | Color Strategy | Implementation Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claymorphism | Playful, soft 3D elements with pill-shaped cards, thick shadows and squishy, tactile surfaces. | Bright, saturated colors with gentle gradients on components over neutral or light backgrounds. | Use large border-radius, layered soft drop-shadows, subtle scale/float animations, and 3D icons for key CTAs. |
| Neo-brutalism | Raw, bold, slightly “harsh” layouts with thick borders, large typography and minimal decoration. | High contrast, solid blocks of saturated color; limited gradients; frequent use of black/white for structure. | Build rigid grids, flat panels with strong outlines, oversized headings and simple hover animations (color or border only). |
| Soft minimalism | Clean, calm interfaces with generous whitespace, soft geometry and friendly typography. | Muted, warm palettes with 1–2 accent colors for focus states and key actions. | Combine rounded containers, light elevation, minimal iconography and reduced motion; prioritize readability and accessibility. |
| Immersive 3D | Hero sections or key visuals using realistic 3D objects, depth and atmospheric lighting. | Limited base palette, with 3D assets providing richer color and light accents. | Integrate 3D renders or Lottie-style animations, parallax scroll, and depth via layered foreground/background elements. |
| Dark mode 2.0 | Refined dark themes with improved contrast, softer surfaces and subtle glow accents. | Deep grays instead of pure black, with neon or vivid accent colors for focus and status. | Use adaptive color tokens for light/dark, elevated cards with low-contrast borders, and motion only for feedback, not decoration. |
